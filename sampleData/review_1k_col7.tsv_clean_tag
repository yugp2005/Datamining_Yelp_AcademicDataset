4	mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g	yGPdA_RETILjRiTPPX7ObA	2012-09-19	review	ISKLP0qxApATxRlUDob6Cg	target is pretty standard if you've been to one of them you'll know largely what to expect from this one that being said this store is clean and the deals one clearance can be good just make sure to check the circular and the website as sometimes additional coupons can be found that the store personnel aren't not_aware of the electronics department staff are not not_very knowledgeable and tried to pressure me into buying a different tv by repeating marketing lingo but were unable to explain what their claims actually were when challenged on them so make sure to do your research beforehand if purchasing electronics
